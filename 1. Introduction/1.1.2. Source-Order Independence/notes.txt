1.1.2. Source-Order Independence
    Note: The reordering capabilities of grid layout intentionally affect only the 
    visual rendering, leaving speech order and navigation based on the source order. 
    This allows authors to manipulate the visual presentation while leaving the source order 
    intact and optimized for non-CSS UAs and for linear models such as speech and sequential 
    navigation.
